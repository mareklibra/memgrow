# MemGrow - Language Learning App Rules

## Project Context
This is a Next.js 16.1.2 language learning application with React 19, using Material Tailwind React for UI components and NextAuth for authentication.

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Follow Next.js App Router patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling

## Component Guidelines
- Import Material Tailwind components from @/app/lib/material-tailwind-compat (never directly from @material-tailwind/react)
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Implement proper accessibility attributes
- Use semantic HTML elements

## File Organization
- Components go in app/ui/
- Server actions go in app/lib/actions/
- Types and interfaces go in app/lib/definitions.ts
- Utilities go in app/lib/utils.ts
- Database queries go in app/lib/data.ts

## Authentication & Security
- Always check authentication status in protected routes
- Use proper session handling with NextAuth
- Validate all user inputs
- Use server actions for data mutations

## Database & API
- Use proper error handling for database operations
- Implement proper TypeScript types for database queries
- Use revalidatePath/revalidateTag for cache invalidation
- Handle async operations properly with await

## Performance
- Use Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- Implement proper loading states
- Use React.memo for expensive computations
- Optimize images with next/image

## Language Learning Specific
- Maintain word progress tracking consistency
- Handle pronunciation audio properly
- Implement proper course and word management
- Use consistent memory level calculations

## Testing & Quality
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Test both development and production builds
- Ensure TypeScript compilation passes
- Validate all forms and user inputs
